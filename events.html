        Spagety currently has 10 different events that it fires throughout its navigation process. These events 
        can either be specified on the <b>spagety</b> module as a global event, or on a per-page basis, by passing
        in a function to the binding. Each event is fired off of the <b>page</b> that triggered it, and then 
        bubbles up until the root page is found. A <b>disableBubbling</b> function can be called on <b>spagety</b>
        module to prevent these events from bubbling up. If a page-event returns <b>preventBubbling: true</b> then 
        the bubbling will not happen.

    <p><ul>
        <li>
            <h2>beforeNavigate:</h2> This is fired on the root page when the navigation is first triggered.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>onSourceError:</h2> This is fired when a resource for a page is not found / did not load properly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>onFound:</h2> This is fired when the url has successfully resolved to the appropriate <b>page</b> binding
            in the tree.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>onNotFound:</h2> This is fired when the url does not resolve to the tree-hierarchy of <b>pages</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>onRedirect:</h2> This is fired if during a navigation the <b>spagety.redirect</b> function is called
            (most likely within a viewModel constructor, or guard).
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>before/after show/hide:</h2> These 4 events are fired before and after the visibility state of a page is changed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>afterNavigate:</h2> This is fired after navigation has completed, after both <b>onFound</b> and <b>onNotFound</b>.
        </li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p>
        The flow of events goes:
