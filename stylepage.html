        You can load <b>CSS</b> files if you need for particular modules. Since you are loading 
        this css file with the module, it implies that it is not global styles, but rather styles
        for the particular module.

    <p>
        The css file is loaded in, then a unique id is generated for the css file based off of
        some of its file characteristics. This unique id is then prepended to each rule, and then 
        the containing element gets the class with the id. The css is then inserted into the head
        with a style tag. This helps to scope the styles to the particular module instead of globablly.

        Here is an example with three different css files, but with the same html.
        <br/>
        <a href='#!/css/ex1'>Example 1</a> | <a href='#!/css/ex2'>Example 2</a> | <a href='#!/css/ex3'>Example 3</a>

    <div data-bind='page: {id: "ex1", html: "styledemo.html", autoShow: true}' class="page"></div>
    <div data-bind='page: {id: "ex2", html: "styledemo.html", css: "style2.css"}' class="page"></div>
    <div data-bind='page: {id: "ex3", html: "styledemo.html", css: "style3.css"}' class="page"></div>
</div>
